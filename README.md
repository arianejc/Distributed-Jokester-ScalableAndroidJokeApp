# Distributed-Jokester-ScalableAndroidJokeApp
Creating a distributed application with a mobile app, a web service interfacing a cloud-based RESTful service, and a dashboard for logging and basic analytics.

**Instructions:**
1. Design a distributed application with a native Android app.
2. Develop a RESTful web service deployed on the cloud.
3. Fetch data from a reputable 3rd party API, avoiding banned APIs and fees.
4. Ensure the Android app communicates with the web service, making HTTP requests and parsing XML/JSON responses.
5. Implement error handling for invalid inputs, network failures, and API unavailability.
6. Create a web-based dashboard using MongoDB for logging and analytics.
7. Log useful information for each request/reply, excluding interactions from the dashboard.
8. Store log data persistently in MongoDB for analysis.
9. Display at least 3 meaningful operations analytics on the dashboard.
10. Ensure the dashboard is accessible via a unique URL and presents formatted logs and analytics.
11. Deploy the web service to GitHub Codespaces for cloud hosting.
12. Test and confirm functionality, ensuring accessibility from both authenticated and unauthenticated browsers.
